of my research questions and the data set.

Reason for choosing it: We thought it would be interesting to see if we could determine if a particular stock
was a good investment using different sampling techniques

Research Question: Is DowDupont Inc. stock a safe or risky investment based on the average change of its stock prices
over 368 days?
Application for real life: Finding the best way to determine if a stock is a good investment to buy by examining if
the stock's volatility.
