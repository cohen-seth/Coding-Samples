This is a project I conducted that focuses on the opioid epidemic in the United States.

In this project I investigated various aspects of the epidemic such as different types of drugs involved, mortality
 rates, rehabilitation success/failure rates, socioeconomic status, gender and race. I created graphics comparing
 and analyzing these factors across the United States. I also focused on over dose rates of different
 towns in Massachusetts.

There are 4 different scripts included in this sample: state_od_count.py, ma_towns.py, gender.py and
  adjusted_opioid_deathrate.py. The data I used was taken from Data.World.
